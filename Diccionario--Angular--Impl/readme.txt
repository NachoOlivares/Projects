This is a Spring Boot App to get a combination of letters from the user and then find words that match with
that combination. You can filter between words that contains the exact letters you are passing, or just
any word that could be made with that letters.

in the folder target there is a jar file named diccionario which contains the service to sort the words,
initiate it before running the project.
I also included the service in the main src so it can be avaliable to peek.
